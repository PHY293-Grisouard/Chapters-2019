    "It is difficult to define what a wave is, but it is easy to recognise one.\n",
    "Perhaps the most general definition of a linear wave is that it is a travelling disturbance, although one by which no matter travels on average, and which obeys a linear dispersion law (to be defined).\n",
    "For example, sound waves are pressure waves. \n",
    "At the microscopic level, molecules of a fluid \"bump\" into each other, but return to their original position on average.\n",
    "The restoring force is simply provided by return of momentum to sender at shock, and damping can happen if the shocks are not completely elastic.\n",
    "The position of a molecule can therefore be very crudely modelled as a SHO or DHO.\n",
    "In a solid, it is the displacement of the atoms around their preferred rest position when the wave travels that in turn displaces neighbouring atoms, etc.\n",
    "On average however, the atoms themselves do not travel.\n",
    "I could multiply the examples: swell, waves in a pond, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves, my very own oceanic internal inertia-gravity waves, stadium waves, and of course the quantum waves that Profs. Krasnopolskaia and Paramekanti will talk about in the rest of PHY293 and 294."

    "* When the bow is removed, towards the end of the video, you can see that very quickly, the oscillation becomes like a fundamental oscillation, and nothing else, the kink is gone. That's because in reality, there is damping, and the higher the harmonic is, the stronger the damping acts on it. Indeed, as we saw before, the kink is reproduced by very high modes, and those modes oscillate faster. Assuming (and this is actually a conservative assumption) that the damping force on a mode $n$ can be modeled as something like $-b\\dot y$ again, then it proportional to the frequency: $F_{damping} \\propto \\sum -\\omega_n\\alpha_n\\sin(\\omega_n t)\\sin(k_nx)$. Therefore, the higher a mode is, the faster the damping is. After a short period of time, damping has killed all the modes but the fundamental, which is the last harmonic standing (pun intended).\n",
