    "*Every continent is surrounded by continental shelves, i.e., regions where the ocean floor is relatively flat, and relatively shallow (less than 500 m deep).\n",
    "You may easily realize this by looking at google maps in satellite mode.\n",
    "In contrast, the \"open-ocean\" is in general much deeper (5 km).\n",
    "Because these two regions of the ocean are much different, they can be thought of as individual oscillators with respect to tidal forcing, with their own resonance frequencies, and their own damping rates: damping is much stronger for tides in shallower seas, because the proximity to the bottom creates much more fluid friction and turbulence.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Some continental shelves are fairly well isolated from the open ocean.\n",
    "The example that is closest to home, but also one of the best examples in the world, is Hudson Bay.\n",
    "It is very large (over 1000 km diameter) and shallow (about 100 m on average), and coupled to the open-ocean via a series of very narrow and even more shallow straits.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*One would think that such an isolated body of water does its own thing, resonating with the tidal forcing without influencing the other bodies of water.\n",
    "This would be neglecting the peculiar properties of resonance, and in particular that even if the coupling is weak between two oscillators, if the forcing provided by the first oscillator to the second oscillator happens to be at a resonance frequency of the second oscillator, the second oscillator will react strongly.\n",
    "As a consequence, the coupled system will have a fundamentally different behaviour than if the two oscillators were uncoupled: modes of oscillation take over, and the behaviour becomes global.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Arbic and his colleagues were interested in paleo-oceanography, and in particular, what were the tides like during the last glacial maximum, were polar ice caps were retaining a lot of the world's water in solid form, above sea level?\n",
    "Then, sea level was more than 100 m below what it is now, and the oscillators as well as the couplings between them must have been very different.\n",
    "They realized it was very complicated, and that the slightest changes in the coastal configuration could change the global tides radically.\n",
    "Take a look at Arbic and Garrett 2010, page 2: they push the analogy as far as drawing two masses linked by springs, go over a discussion about damping, plot the same resonance curves that I drew in chapter 3, etc.!*\n",
