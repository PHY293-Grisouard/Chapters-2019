You might notice that in his preface, he mentions that his book is designed for a first-year class, for which eigenvalues and eigenvectors would be too advanced a topic. It is our strong opinion (all the instructors involved in PHY293 and 294) that we need to cover this topic in this second-year class, because it is foundational for a lot of other topics that will be tackled in the rest of PHY293-4. If you want a book for help, I can recommend John R. Taylor's \"Classical Mechanics\" (University Science Books), chapter 11, which I am loosely following.*\n",

    "You may easily realize this by looking at google maps in satellite mode.\n",
    "In contrast, the \"open-ocean\" is in general much deeper (5 km).\n",
    "Because these two regions of the ocean are much different, they can be thought of as individual oscillators with respect to tidal forcing, with their own resonance frequencies, and their own damping rates: damping is much stronger for tides in shallower seas, because the proximity to the bottom creates much more fluid friction and turbulence.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Some continental shelves are fairly well isolated from the open ocean.\n",
    "The example that is closest to home, but also one of the best examples in the world, is Hudson Bay.\n",
    "It is very large (over 1000 km diameter) and shallow (about 100 m on average), and coupled to the open-ocean via a series of very narrow and even more shallow straits.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*One would think that such an isolated body of water does its own thing, resonating with the tidal forcing without influencing the other bodies of water.\n",
    "This would be neglecting the peculiar properties of resonance, and in particular that even if the coupling is weak between two oscillators, if the forcing provided by the first oscillator to the second oscillator happens to be at a resonance frequency of the second oscillator, the second oscillator will react strongly.\n",
    "As a consequence, the coupled system will have a fundamentally different behaviour than if the two oscillators were uncoupled: modes of oscillation take over, and the behaviour becomes global.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Arbic and his colleagues were interested in paleo-oceanography, and in particular, what were the tides like during the last glacial maximum, were polar ice caps were retaining a lot of the world's water in solid form, above sea level?\n",
    "Then, sea level was more than 100 m below what it is now, and the oscillators as well as the couplings between them must have been very different.\n",
    "They realized it was very complicated, and that the slightest changes in the coastal configuration could change the global tides radically.\n",
    "Take a look at Arbic and Garrett 2010, page 2: they push the analogy as far as drawing two masses linked by springs, go over a discussion about damping, plot the same resonance curves that I drew in chapter 3, etc.!*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The two articles that I am citing are proof-of-concept kind of articles, where they run numerical simulations of ocean tides in which they artificially change tiny bits of coasts.\n",
    "In particular, they block Hudson Strait between Hudson Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, and find that the tides are completely modified everywhere in the Atlantic Ocean (see figure here, i.e., fig. 15a, b, c of Arbic et al. 2009, reproduced here.) and even as far as India, were a 20 cm increase in tidal amplitude happens!*"

    "* For some modes, some masses don't move, or hardly at all. Likewise, some masses move symmetrically around points that would be associated with zero velocity if they had a mass on them. Such points are called \"nodes\". In-between nodes are locations where the velocities seem larger. These points are called \"antinodes\". We will be able to visualize them better with waves on a string.\n",
    "* The distance between two nodes corresponds to half a wavelength: every two nodes, the motion is periodic (spatial periodicity).\n",
    "* The larger the mode number (or the frequency) is, the more nodes there are, or equivalently, the shorter the wavelengths are. As a matter of fact, the first mode has zero nodes, the second mode has one node, and the $n^{th}$ has $n-1$ nodes. This is a general feature of standing waves, again better visualized with waves on a string.\n",
    "* Modes with more nodes are called \"higher modes\", those with less nodes are called \"low\", or \"grave\". The terminology comes from sound waves. Sound waves with larger wavelengths sound indeed graver (lower frequency) than sound waves with smaller wavelengths (higher frequencies)."
