    "* For some modes, some masses don't move, or hardly at all. Likewise, some masses move symmetrically around points that would be associated with zero velocity if they had a mass on them. Such points are called \"nodes\". In-between nodes are locations where the velocities seem larger. These points are called \"antinodes\". We will be able to visualize them better with waves on a string.\n",
    "* The distance between two nodes corresponds to half a wavelength: every two nodes, the motion is periodic (spatial periodicity).\n",
    "* The larger the mode number (or the frequency) is, the more nodes there are, or equivalently, the shorter the wavelengths are. As a matter of fact, the first mode has zero nodes, the second mode has one node, and the $n^{th}$ has $n-1$ nodes. This is a general feature of standing waves, again better visualized with waves on a string.\n",
    "* Modes with more nodes are called \"higher modes\", those with less nodes are called \"low\", or \"grave\". The terminology comes from sound waves. Sound waves with larger wavelengths sound indeed graver (lower frequency) than sound waves with smaller wavelengths (higher frequencies)."
